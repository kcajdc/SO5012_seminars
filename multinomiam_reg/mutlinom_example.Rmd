## Introduction

This seminar sheet is intended as a introduction to multinomial regression and is a combination of code and **inpterpreation** for the worksheet *SO5012_semX_multinomial_regression.docx*. 

As with all the previous weeks, first we need to:
1. Set the working directory
2. Load the packages we'll be using
3. Load the data

Here we'll use the `echo = false` command on the r chunk so that our output is not filled up by this set up code, although the code will be vivible. 

```{r loading, echo=FALSE}


```
